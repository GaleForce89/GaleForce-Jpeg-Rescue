# GaleForce-Jpeg-Rescue
GaleForce Jpeg Rescue (GFJR) a free tool used to extract jpegs from binary data, especially those with bad exif producing a false app0 marker due to class design.

# NOTES
Need to optimize and add generator for large files, rework the loop as it took much trial and error understanding why python produces different output for bytes such as test[x] vs test[x:y].
